# Defender
Defender style arcade game for the GBA

The object of the game is to dodge as many of aliens as possible without collisions.
One alien is first added, then every 10 seconds double the previous amount is added
for increasing difficulty.
The sprites aren't broken, its an expression of "Retro-postmodern cubism"
The music playing is based on a bit-shift variation algorithm with a period of about
16 minutes.
