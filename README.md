# Defender
Defender style arcade game for the GBA

The object of the game is to dodge as many of aliens as possible without collisions.
One alien is first added, then every 10 seconds double the previous amount is added
for increasing difficulty.
The sprites aren't broken, its an expression of "Retro-postmodern cubism"

Currently there is a bug that occurs when the music loops causing sprites to misbehave

# Dependencies:
